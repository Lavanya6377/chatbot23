## Python Chatbot Project

This Python chatbot project uses machine learning to create a responsive conversational agent. The project comprises three main components:

1. **`intents.json`**: Defines various user intents such as greetings, farewells, and queries about age, name, programming, and more.
2. **`training.py`**: Preprocesses the intents data, tokenizes text, and trains a TensorFlow/Keras neural network model for intent classification.
3. **`chatbot.py`**: Loads the trained model and interacts with users in real-time, using NLTK for text preprocessing. The bot responds based on predicted intents, providing appropriate answers from `intents.json`.
