This Python chatbot project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning to create a responsive conversational agent. The project includes three main components: `intents.json` defines various user intents such as greetings, goodbye, and queries about age, name, programming, and more. `training.py` preprocesses the intents data, tokenizes text, and trains a TensorFlow/Keras neural network model for intent classification. Finally, `chatbot.py` loads the trained model and interacts with users in real-time, using NLTK for text preprocessing. The bot responds based on predicted intents, providing appropriate answers sourced from `intents.json`.
